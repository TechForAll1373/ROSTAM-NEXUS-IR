# Contributing to ROSTAM NEXUS 💚🤍❤️ 🟢⚪🔴

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your help makes this armory truly infinite.

## 📌 How Can I Contribute?

### 🧩 Adding a New Tool
1. **Check** if the tool is already listed (search the README or `index.html`).
2. **Fork** the repo and create a new branch.
3. **Edit `index.html`** – add your tool to the `database` array (follow the existing format: name, sub, desc, tags, cat, and relevant URLs).
4. **Update the README** – add a row in the appropriate category table (use the same markdown style).
5. **Test** – open `index.html` locally to ensure your entry appears correctly and filters work.
6. **Commit** with a clear message (e.g., `Add SuperVPN to mobile VPN section`).
7. **Push** and open a Pull Request.
